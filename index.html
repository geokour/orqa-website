		    <p class="p-heading p-large">OrQA: Organ Quality Assessment is a multidisciplinary project involving academics, clinicians and software engineers. The aim of this project is to leverage moderm machine learning techniques to generate robust automated predictions of transplant viability from images of candidate organs. If you are involved in organ transplant and would like to learn more about how you can get involved <a class="page-scroll" href="#contact">please get in touch.</a></p>
