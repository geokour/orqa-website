## About

Transplantation is the best treatment for patients with organ failure irrespective of the organ required. Currently over 6,000
patients are waiting in the United Kingdom. Focusing on kidney transplantation the figures are stark with a patient living twice
as long with a transplant, when compared with dialysis, and over ten years a kidney transplant saves the NHS £420,000 per
patient.    

Organs donated for transplantation are sometimes not used because of concerns about infections or cancer, but most
commonly because of worries that they won’t function adequately in the recipient and might lead directly to the patient dying. At
the moment assessing organs for transplantation is subjective and depends on the skills of the surgical team. In the United
Kingdom the rate of use of organs varies widely between centres, from 70% to 30%. This device aims to support all surgeons
to use the achievable 70% of donated organs.

This project will involve training machine learning models to score the quality of organs being considered for transplantation.

## Built With

This project uses GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
This site requires Ruby and Jekyll to run locally. [Jekyll quickstart docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

### Installation

First install Ruby as Jekyll is a Gemfile. 
[Installing Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

Then install the bundler package.


```gem install jekyll bundler```

Next initialise bundler. This writes a gemfile (if needed).


```bundle init```

Add the Jeykll gem.

```bundle add jekyll```

NB: on linux at least, after installing ruby and the bundler package as above, you then need to:

install missing gem executables (these seem to be based on the gem file which is present in this code)
```bundle install ```
(NB: on a fresh linux such as vm, need make, npm and node. Also needed ubuntu-dev-tools and build-essential.) Also, issue with the snap install of ruby, seems it is better to use the apt install. 

NB need to add jekyll-paginate,jekyll-sitemap,jekyll-gist,jekyll-feed and jekyll-include-cache to gemfile.

### Running Locally

Run the webserver at: locahost:4000

```bundle exec jekyll serve```  

## Deployment

### Production

A push to the main branch triggers a rebuild.

## Usage

http://info.orqa.uk/

## Roadmap

- [x] Initial Research  
- [x] Minimum viable product 
- [ ] Alpha Release  
- [ ] Feature-Complete Release  

## Contributing

### Main Branch
Protected and can only be pushed to via pull requests. Should be considered stable and a representation of production code.

### Dev Branch
Should be considered fragile, code should compile and run but features may be prone to errors.

### Feature Branches
A branch per feature being worked on.
